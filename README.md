# Some classic sorting algorithms

Those are:

- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort

Made in rust :crab:

## Usage

Once with `rust` and `cargo` correctly installed, just run:

```terminal
cargo run
```

In the future i plan to make this repo as assignment for those interested in implementing these algorithms. Also, this may be used in a college work so if you study with me please don't copy.
