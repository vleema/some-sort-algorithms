# Some classic sorting algorithms

Hi visitor :alien: I challenge you to implement these algorithms in Rust :crab:

- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort

> In the `src/algorithms.rs` files are the descriptions of these algorithms, and a overview of the implementation.

To test your implementation, you may run the program with:

```terminal
cargo test
```

If you want to see the performance of your implementation you may run with:

```terminal
cargo run
```

or

```terminal
cargo run --release
```

To compile and run with all runtime optimizations.
